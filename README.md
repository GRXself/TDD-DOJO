# TDD-DOJO
In this repo, there are some practices for basic coding skill,
such as 
- Using TDD to finsh functionality.
- Using refactor to clean up the code smell...
- Using some basic principle to add more sense of designs for the code.

## FizzBuzz -- Used for **Baby Steps** coding.

**Requirements:**
1. Count out from 1 to 100.
2. Say **Fizz** if number is mutiple of 3.
3. Say **Buzz** if number is mutiple of 5.
4. Say **FizzBuzz** if number is mutilpe of both 3 and 5.

*Additional requirements based on above:*
1. Say **Fizz** if number is including 3.
2. Say **Buzz** if number is including 5.
3. Say **FizzBuzz** if number is including both 3 and 5.

## Fibonacci -- Used for considering how to solve stack overflow exception.

**Requirement:**

Print the value of **120th** [Fibonacci sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html).

*Additional requirement:*

Modify the rule of fibonacci from sum of two numbers to three numbers and this sequence starts from [1,1,1].
Then out put the 120th value in this sequence. Please record how many places you changed in your code
and consider how to reduce them.

## Five-card stud -- used for TDD, Refactor and simple design patterns practice.
